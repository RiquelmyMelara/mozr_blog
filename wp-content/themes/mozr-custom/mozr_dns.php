            <p>Our leveraged DNS services are designed to be fast and simple. Whether you’re a developer

            protocol works, Mozr is here to help. Route 53 has low latency and even a self-service API for
            development workflows.</p>
            <p>Route 53 gives you hosted zone capabilities providing flexibility to add DNS records at-will, or
            site owners can transfer DNS hosting services to Amazon for a currently hosted domain. Auto-
            matically integrate load balancers and route customers to an Amazon EC2 region.</p>
