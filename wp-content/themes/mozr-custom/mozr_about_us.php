            <p>Build technology that optimizes the online shopping experience</p>

            <h2>Our Story</h2>

            <p>MOZR came into existence as a result of a major online retailer having difficulty scaling their WooCommerce website. A custom cloud infrastructure was built on AWS using auto-scaling and high availability technology ensuring the client's store would always stay online, even in times of extreme traffic.</p>

            <p>After building this cloud infrastructure, the team began to receive requests from other online retailers to build similar infrastructures.</p>

            <p>Since then MOZR has expanded its offering to include a full suite of tools to help online retailers make the online shopping experience better for their customers.</p>
