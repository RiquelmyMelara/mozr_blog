            <p>Mozr leverages the power of Amazon Web Services (AWS), which allows us to provide a</p>

            <p>99.95% uptime guarantee. We prioritize our customersâ€™ speed, stability, scalability and sus-
            tainability. Our guarantee ensures that your applications and websites will always stay availa-
            ble for your customers regardless of your location, business hours, and peak traffic times.</p>

            <p>Every reasonable effort is used to keep your data safe, ensure sustainability for your applica-
            tions and consistently maintain availability for customers 24/7. Without a good host that fo-
            cuses on uptime, you could lose millions in revenue from downtime.</p>

            <p>Having good uptime affects brand loyalty. Imagine visiting a site frequently down due to tech-
            nical issues. Would you continue to visit the site and provide the business with sensitive data?</p>

            <p>Or would you find an alternative? Statistics show that most customers leave a site after
            three-second delays in load time. Your business revenue depends on uptime, and our service
            provides only the best in infrastructure. Our leveraged AWS infrastructure improves brand
            loyalty and avoids lost revenue due to technical issue.</p>

            <p>Not only does Mozr provide superior uptime guarantees, but our AWS hosting also contains
            monitoring services in case of an event. Amazon monitoring provides a way for Mozr and you
            to identify an event before it becomes a disaster. It gives us and AWS IT the ability to remedy
            the situation before downtime occurs.</p>
