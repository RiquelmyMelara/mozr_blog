            <p>Data centers power the world’s Internet activity. Without them, Internet speed would be limited
            to single servers and poor bandwidth. Mozr builds its foundation on Amazon Web Services
            (AWS), which has numerous data centers across the globe. These data centers ensure only the
            highest quality in website speed, availability, sustainability, scalability and security.</p>
            
            <p>When you think data centers, you think of several high-powered computers housed in massive
            infrastructure, but there is much more to building stable resources for millions of people across
            the globe.</p>

            <h3>Infrastructure</h3>
            <p>Building infrastructure in layers allows the data center to secure

            hardware based on prioritization of data and need-to-know compliance. 
            Every technician isn’t given full access by default. Instead, infrastructure 
            in layers provides operational security for businesses

            that require protection of sensitive data.</p>
            <p>Infrastructure is closely monitored, reviewed, and any alerts are diagnosed 
                as an emergency. This gives you only the best support

            during disaster recovery and provides better business continuity.</p>

            <h3>Perimeters</h3>
            <p>It’s not enough to protect the internal infrastructure. Perimeter security 
                protects from the outside. AWS builds its data centers as impenetrable 
            fortresses with access highly scrutinized. Entry into its
            
            building must be authorized, and access is layered between locked
            
            doors. Only staff with proper authority can gain access to the premises 
            and server racks.</p>
            <p>AWS has data centers across the globe, and every one is set up with
            top-notch monitoring, triaging, and security programs running 24/7.</p>

            <h3>Data Layer</h3>
            <p>The data layer is where most security is focused. It’s the area in
            which your customer data resides. Our hosting solution with AWS
            
            prevents both physical and virtual intrusions using detection monitoring, 
            lock-and-key physical security, security cameras, triggered
            
            alerts, media storage with a high-impact life-cycle and taped footage
            of any suspicious events.</p>

            <h3>Environmental Layer</h3>
            <p>AWS addresses environmental risks using the latest technology and
            greener data center procedures. With data centers in different
            parts of the world, it’s important that these buildings are centered
            in a location that allows for security but also keeps a small footprint
            on its environmental surroundings.</p>
            <p>Customers benefit by having multiple availability zones without interruption 
            with safeguards that detect natural disasters before they
            
            hit including water-detecting devices, fire alarms and suppression
            equipment.</p>
